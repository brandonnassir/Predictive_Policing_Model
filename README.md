# Predictive_Policing_Model

Overview

This repository is dedicated to the development of a predictive policing model aimed at forecasting the locations of future crime occurrences within the City of Los Angeles. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and comprehensive data analysis, this project seeks to enhance public safety resources through targeted predictions.

Repository Contents

This repository comprises several Jupyter notebooks, each serving a unique purpose within the broader scope of the project:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This notebook provides a thorough analysis of crime instances in Los Angeles, featuring detailed visualizations of crime patterns and trends over time.
Dimensionality Reduction: Utilizes an autoencoder to effectively reduce the dimensionality of geospatial data, preparing it for more efficient processing.
Crime Prediction Model: Trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict hourly crime occurrences throughout various regions of the city.
Model Performance

The LSTM model developed through this project has demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities, as evidenced by its performance metrics on the test set:

Accuracy: 97%
Precision: 92%
Recall: 95%
F1 Score: 94%
These metrics underscore the modelâ€™s robustness and its potential as a tool for predictive policing.
